This document describes the various roles involved with running the meetings involved in the production of the learning path.
All of these roles should be filled and completed for each meeting to be as successful as possible.
The roles are:

* [Scheduler]
* [Crier]
* [Facilitator]
* [Scribe]

<a name="scheduler"></a>
## Scheduler

The _Scheduler_ sends the calendar invite for the meeting.

**Within 24 Hours of Previous Meeting**
* [ ] Create an agenda document for the next meeting by copying this [template][template] into the [learning path folder].
* [ ] Open the document and follow the steps in the "_Do these things to set up this document_" section.
* [ ] Send the calendar invite for the next meeting.
This invite must include:

  * Conference call info.
  * Comment-enabled link to the agenda document.

### Tips

* The _Scribe_ should have included the time of the meeting in the notes from the previous meeting. 
* Include everyone from the previous meeting on the invite for the next meeting.
An easy way to do this using _Outlook_ is to reply by meeting to the notes email from the previous meeting.
* The title of the meeting should be "Inner Source Learning Path Working Session".
* You can use your favorite corporate conference call system or create a Google Hangout.
* Check out this [writeup][gdoc sharing] if you need help creating a comment-enabled link to the agenda document.

## Crier

The _Crier_ reminds people in _Slack_ of the upcoming meeting.

**About 24 Hours Before Meeting**

* [ ] Announce the meeting in the [#learning-path] channel.
* [ ] Share that announcement with the [#innersourcecommons] channel.

### Tips

* Ensure that the announcement has enough information for people to join the meeting _even if they don't have the calendar invite_.
That means at a minimum the announcement has the meeting day, time, and call info.
* Try to make the announcement engaging so that even people that have not participated before may be interested in joining.
* Here is an [example announcement][#learning-path announcement] in the #learning-path channel and [its share][#innersourcecommons share] in the #innersourcecommons channel.

## Facilitator

The _Facilitator_ conducts the meeting so that all of the agenda items are finished within the allotted time.

**Day Before Meeting**

* [ ] Review the agenda and ensure that you are reasonably familiar with each item on it.

**During Meeting**

* [ ] Facilitate the meeting according to the **Tips** below.

### Tips

* Have the agenda open and share your screen with the people on the call.
* Guide the group through reviewing each agenda item from top to bottom.
* The purpose of reviewing each agenda item is to generate actionable, assigned next steps.  Accordingly:

  * Guide the conversation towards understanding what is blocking the item's progression and what can be done to advance it.
  * Strive for each task to be assigned to a volunteer on the call.
  * When all such tasks have been assigned, move on to the next agenda item.
  
* When reviewing the project board:

  * Treat each issue in the **In Review** and **In Progress** columns as if it were its own item on the agenda.
  * The **Done** column does not need review.
  * Call out if anyone would like to review any issue in the **To Do** column.
  If so, then treat that issue like a regular agenda item.
  If not, then no further discussion is needed.

* Remember that it's OK to finish early.
Once the agenda is complete the meeting is over.
* At the close of the call thank everyone for participating.

## Scribe

The _Scribe_ takes and sends out the meeting notes.

**Day Before Meeting**

* [ ] Reserve time on tomorrow's calendar to transcribe your meeting notes into the **Notes** section of the agenda document.
This time should be scheduled as close as possible after the end of the meeting.

**During Meeting**

* [ ] Note the first names of each meeting attendee.
* [ ] Take copious notes to yourself of everything relating to the salient points and assignments of the meeting.

**Within 24 Hours of Meeting**

* [ ] Distill your copious notes into just what is needed to document the salient points and assignments of the meeting.
Be sure to include the time of next meeting.
* [ ] Put these polished notes into the **Notes** section of the agenda document.
* [ ] Email the notes to everyone on the meeting invite.
This email should include (in order):

  * Link to the agenda document where the notes are located.
  * Chatham House Rule disclaimer.
  * Copy/pasted notes from the agenda document.

### Tips

* Ensure that a regular attendee who is not at the meeting could understand what happened by the notes only.
* Make the notes clear and to the point.
Part of your service as _Scribe_ is to summarize the key points of what was said
so that recipients don't need to wade through all of the conversation in order to understand its essentials.
* Here is a [sample email].
* An easy way to send the notes to everyone on the meeting invite is to "Reply all" to the invite.
