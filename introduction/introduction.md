# Introduction

This Learning Path gives an introduction to inner source.
Inner source is the application of open source practices and principles to internal software development.
This strategy enables wide and effective collaboration, producing software that is responsive and nimble to the changing needs of its many internal consumers.


This Learning Path teaches how to recognize situations that are good candidates for inner source.
We'll outline at a high level how inner source can help in those situations.
You'll become familiar with shared terms used when discussing inner source.
We'll also enumerate the key principles upon-which inner source is based and the benefits seen when it is applied effectively.
