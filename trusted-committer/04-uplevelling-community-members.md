## Uplevelling Community Members 

Let's talk about participation. There is a continuum of participation in an
InnerSource community. There are people not even aware of the community,
_newcomers_ which are aware of the community but have not yet used or contributed
to the software, _consumers_ which already use the software, _contributors_ who
have made at least one contribution and _TCs_, who take responsibility for both
the software and the community. As a TC, you are responsible for moving
individuals along this continuum and to uplevel their ability to make
contributions. In that sense, TCs act as force multipliers in their community. 

As indicated earlier, it is helpful for TCs to engage in marketing their
product and their community, in order to increase the number of newcomers and
consumers. They should communicate opportunities for making contributions to
consumers and try to elicit and align the interests of potential contributors
with that of the community. What often works well is if contributors were able
to work on something that made their day job easier, e.g. development tools and automation.

Finally, it is the TCs responsibility to identify contributors with the
potential to grow.  They should foster and nurture that growth by getting
contributors excited for tackling challenging tasks and to mentor or coach them
while they are performing them. This is, in our opinion, the noblest
responsibility a TC has. It is rewarding for both the contributor and the
TC alike. We have heard from TCs that mentoring and seeing people level up
their abilities more than makes up for the fact that they have less time to
actually spend writing software. 

As mentioned in the previous section, learning and personal growth are reasons
why people join and stick around in an InnerSource community. Upleveling their
contributors is one of the most powerful tools TCs have at their disposal to
increase the speed, output and longevity of their community. It is also one of
the key arguments with which to convince management to allow their employees to
participate in an InnerSource community, as that will make their employees more 
valuable to them, to the company overall and it will help retain top talent.

In summary, TCs need to attract new contributors and level up their ability to
make contributions.  This activity ultimately levels up the community's ability to create
better software faster. They do so by communicating opportunities to make 
contributions and by helping and mentoring contributors to grow
