## Advocating for the Community's Needs

InnerSource communities exist in a corporate context and are thus more
constrained than Open Source Communities. There can be times when a business
unit's interests are at odds with those of the community. Companies are more
concerned with the bottom line and thus with the products produced by an
InnerSource community. They are also often more concerned with the short and
medium term results of the community.  InnerSource communities, on the other
hand understand that a healthy community is a precondition for healthy code and
are naturally more concerned with the longevity of both the product and the
community. This is why many InnerSource initiatives were modeled after the
Apache Way, which has the motto "Community over Code". 

It is in this potential area of conflict where the TC plays a vital role. TCs
build trust with the organization and, building on that trust, act as an
advocate for the interests of the community and the long term health of the
software in the company. They are responsible for communicating technical as
well community related risks to management. At the same time, TCs need to be
strategic and work within the degrees of freedom afforded by their companies.

Related to this, TCs need to make sure that the community and individual
contributors get public credit for their work, to make sure everyone is aware
of the valuable contribution made. Public credit is kind of the currency in which
contributors are being paid, especially those who contribute voluntarily. It is
good practice to commend valuable contributors publicly and making sure their
managers are CC'd as well. Neglecting to give credit, on the other hand, can be
hugely frustrating for individual contributors and very detrimental for the
health of the community overall. Neglecting to give credit can occur in
companies which are not yet accustomed to the InnerSource working model or when
the software being developed by the InnerSource community runs _behind the
scenes_ and managers were simply not aware of the community's contribution. A
good TC will engage with management and advocate the need for
public credit in this case. Failure to give credit is almost never done in bad
faith, though, and TCs should be able to easily correct that. 

Another common example where the TC's advocacy is needed is when contributors
are not given time or permission to make a contribution.  This situation can can happen if
the community is not working on a product that belongs to the domain of the contributor's
department and thus not relevant for the respective manager's goals.
In this case, the TC should engage in discussion with the contributor's manager
and lobby for an alternative decision.

In summary, there are many situations in which TCs need to advocate the
interests of individual contributors and their community as a whole to the
organization. They do this because they understand that the value that the
community can provide to the organization depends on the health and longevity
of the community and ultimately on a trustworthy relationship between both.
