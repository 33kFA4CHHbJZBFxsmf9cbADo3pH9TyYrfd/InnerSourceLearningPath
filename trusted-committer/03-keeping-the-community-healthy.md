# Keeping the community healthy

The introduction points out that Trusted Committers have both tech oriented and community
oriented responsibilities. It is not sufficient to focus on code and code
health only. To ensure success in the long run, Trusted Committers should strive for keeping
the community which is building the software healthy as well. Because of that, they
must strike a good balance between effort spent on ensuring product quality and
growing a healthy community. 

What does a healthy community look like? Quite simply, in a healthy community,
[_Contributors_][CO Introduction] tend to stick around, can spend most of their time on developing
software and are able to level up their abilities. As a result, a healthy
community will also be growing. 

Why do [_Contributors_][CO Introduction] join and stick around in a community? Some do because they
subscribe to the purpose or the mission of the community. It is the Trusted Committer's job to
clearly articulate and promote this purpose. The importance of this is often
not recognized - marketing a community and their products is truly essential.

Another, more obvious reason for people to stick around is that they enjoy
working with other members of the community, including the Trusted Committers. In my
experience, what this comes down to is that community members treat and
communicate with each other with utmost respect. Contributions are treated as
like a gift or a donation, rather than something that detracts from their own
work and they laud excellent and especially first contributions. The Trusted Committer's job
in all this is primarily to set an example for others, similarly to setting an
example for the level of software quality that is expected.  If necessary, the
Trusted Committers are the ones who should create and enact a code of conduct for the
community. Should there be community members whose behavior is detrimental or
even toxic to the community health, it is the Trusted Committer's responsibility to either
try and change or contain this or, in the worst case, to remove people from the
community. Trusted Committers should create opportunities for people to get together
regularly and get to know each other personally.

Another reason for people to stick around is that their
work in an InnerSource community was an excellent opportunity to acquire new
skills and to grow personally. This is again where the role of the Trusted Committer is really
important. Trusted Committers often become mentors for junior developers, and they explicitly
spend time during pull requests not only to point out areas for improvement but
also explain in detail why something needs to be improved.  This explanation includes the theory
or experience behind it and offering suggestions on how it is best done. By doing
so, the Trusted Committers will often be able to increase the speed of learning in their
communities far beyond what is common in traditional software development
projects. 

We believe that Trusted Committers should prioritize onboarding and mentoring during pull
requests over reaching communicated release dates, unless there is a very
good reason not to. Trusted Committers do this because they understand the virtuous cycle:
good mentoring in pull requests leads to a higher level of trust and engagement on part
of the [_Contributors_][CO Introduction] which in turn leads to more people willing to make
contributions and thus more contributions. We'll discuss more about this in the
segment in ["Upleveling the Community"](https://github.com/InnerSourceCommons/InnerSourceLearningPath/blob/master/trusted-committer/04-uplevelling-community-members.md).

Finally, some people stick around in InnerSource communities because they get
to focus on developing software and to spend as little time as possible on
activities which are considered overhead or waste, common especially in large
companies with a strong focus on processes.  The Trusted Committer's job in this context is to
ensure that [_Contributors_][CO Introduction] can actually do that and generally to keep things
running smoothly. This includes communicating and enacting helpful
contribution guidelines.

One important aspect of these is to explain what I
call _signaling_ in pull requests: what should a comment look like? What does
it mean if I _like_ or _+1_ a comment?  How is @mentioning someone with a /CC
prefix different from doing so with a /FYI prefix? Generally speaking, Trusted Committers need
to make sure that the contribution process uncovers problems, rather than being
the cause of them.  Ultimately, Trusted Committers should empower their community to point out
process related problems and to adapt and improve them as a community as much
as possible.

For Trusted Committers to be able to fulfill all these responsibilities, it is important that
they communicate regularly with community members and _keep an ear to the 
ground_ so to speak, so that they are aware of the community's needs. We'll
go into more detail about this in the section in ["Advocating the Community's
Needs"](https://github.com/InnerSourceCommons/InnerSourceLearningPath/blob/master/trusted-committer/06-advocating-for-the-communitys-needs.md).

In summary, Trusted Committers should strive to create a welcoming and appreciative
environment for their [_Contributors_][CO Introduction] that allows them to concentrate on writing
software and to grow personally by creating opportunities to learn from other
community members.
