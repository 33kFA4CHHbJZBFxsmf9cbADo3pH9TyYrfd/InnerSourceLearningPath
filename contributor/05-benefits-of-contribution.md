## Benefits of becoming an InnerSource Contributor

Contributors are the life blood of Inner Source projects.  Every project that is
run as an Inner Source project comes both with the promise and with the ultimate
goal of expanding their development team beyond the original founders.  The project taps
into the potential for further collaborators amongs users (also sometimes
referred to as customers in corporations) of that project.```

However what would motivate an individual developer to spend time on a project
that is not under the direction of their manager? What would motivate a manager
to make time for their developers to improve projects that are not 100% under
their purview?

### Individual motivation

The most obvious motivation is what typically draws early contributors into open
source as well:

Rememember that annoying bug you've been working around for so long? The time
and energy that maintainting those workarounds costs? What if instead of waiting for
the upstream team to fix that issue sometime in the future, you could go ahead
and fix it yourself? Often in a "scratch your own itch" kind of approach first-time
contributors start with fixing issues in projects they depend on for their
daily work to reduce the number of workarounds in their own codebase.

When deciding whether to create and contribute a fix instead of maintaining your
own workaround - think about the benefit that the contribution will bring to
your own changes.  Instead of working in isolation, those working on the upstream
project will be able to not only review but also improve your solution. You get
support and mentoring which greatly speeds up your own development effort.

Spending more time with others means that over time you will learn how the team
works, how it organises itself, which tooling it uses in which way to build
their project. Oftentimes your own projects wil benefit from that experience:
Instead of only reading about some new library or build system you'll be able to
gain practical experience with it before going ahead and introducing that in
your own projects. Working on more than one core project means that you will be
exposed to a larger ecosystem from which to draw best practices and solutions to
challenges.

A nice side effect of being able to spend some of your time in other teams is
that your reputation and impact expands the boundaries of your own team. So in
addition to yourself learning and growing from others you get to influence
projects.  You influence directly via your own contributions but also by
sharing your experience and knowledge on project tooling and setup.  This sharing might
help the upstream project improve and accelerate development cycles.
projects, both in a very specific way by your own contributions but also by
sharing your experience and knowledge on project tooling and setup that might
help the upstream project improve and accelerate development cycles.

Aside from all of those objective criteria there is a component that is very
hard to meassure but has been reported both in InnerSource and in Open Source
projects alike: People participate, because they find work on those project
personally fullfilling and fun. Most likely the aspect of being in a position
to truely self select tasks to work on does play an important role for that.
This self selection typically also leads to host projects being very welcoming
and supportive as those are key to keeping motivation in contributors up.


### Team level motivation

Rememember that annoying bug that's suddenly fixed upstream? Why should your
team spend the extra effort to contribute that fix to the upstream project?

For one it means that maintenance cost and time suddenly is with the upstream
project.  For every new release it's on them instead of on your team to make it
keeps working with your modifications and requirements.

Having team members work as active contributors in projects your team depends on
means that likely they will get to have a say in project direction and timelines,
which can be beneficial for your team.

By using InnerSource teams can establish a middle path between "be independent
and build your own" (including any number of new bugs that you own) and "safe
time and money by relying on existing implementations" (at the cost of creating
long term dependencies that can only be influenced in a limited way. That way
balancing reimplementing versus reusing becomes easier.

### Company motivation

Remember that functionality that's specific to your company's domain - but that
is maintained in mutiple implementations across the entire company? What if
there were a way to avoid a dozen buggy implementations and merge them into a
shared asset with a development process attached that avoids the usual
drain of energy that central dependencies bring to the table? Many open source
projects are being used by a huge number of players - some of which participate
in their design and development. Encouraging cross team collarboration in Inner
Source projects at the corporate level means that you can drive central
innovation from the edges of your organisation.

In general it is well understood that projects with a [bus
factor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor) of one or two people pose a
risk to the organisation - all the more, when that project turns out to be
central to the purpose of the business. Inner Source helps not only with making such
projects transparent, but also provides tools to improve that situation by
putting focus on mentoring and expanding the contributor base.

While cross team collaboration makes assessing individual contributions hard,
it also enables learning and knowledge sharing withing an organisation. As a
result, the impact of individuals will improve. Best practices and positive
innovation will spread more easily across the entire organisation. As a side
effect, improvements to the work environment will more easily spread across the
organization - helping retain employees.

On the technological side more eyes with a more diverse background implies that
code changes will be put under much more scrutiny, leading to better overall
quality and security.

Finally, a focus on enabling project users and customers to participate in
development means that there is a very clear incentive to make these projects
easy to get started with: Based on standard tooling, easy to understand, easy to
re-use and as a result more modular and replaceable.

## Conclusion

As we've seen in this article many of the reasons for individuals and
corporations to get active in Open Source also apply to Inner Source projects.
What we've seen as well is that it's not only altruistic reasons that drive
people to collaborate in Inner Source projects - often it's easy to identify
business reasons for when collaboration like this makes a lot of sense.
