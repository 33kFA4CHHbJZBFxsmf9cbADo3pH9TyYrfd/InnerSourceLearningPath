## Benefits of becoming an InnerSource Contributor

Contributors are the life blood of Inner Source projects: Every project that is
run as an Inner Source project comes both with the promise and with the ultimate
goal of expanding their development team beyond the original founders, tapping
into the potential for further collaborators amongs users (also sometimes
referred to as customers in corporations) of that project.

However what would motivate an individual developer to spend time on a project
that is not under the direction of their manager? What would motivate a manager
to make time for their developers to improve projects that are not 100% under
their purview?

### Individual motivation

The most obvious motivation is what typically draws early contributors into open
source as well:

Rememember that annoying bug you've been working around for so long? The time
and energy mainainting those workarounds costs? What if instead of waiting for
the upstream team to fix that issue sometime in the future, you could go ahead
and fix it yourself? Often in a scratch your own itch kind of approach first
time contributors start with fixing issues in projects they depend on for their
daily work to reduce the number of workarounds in their own codebase.
