# InnerSource Contributor Content Outline

## Introduction/Rationale
   - Quick Overview of Roles
      - Explain how contributor role relates to other roles
   - Discuss the value of contribution
      - ‘With many eyes, all bugs are shallow’
      - Improve cross-company collaboration
      - Reduce single points of failure (team or personal)
   - Contribution Rationale
      - Prevent/reduce duplication of efforts through many teams

      - Things that you gain as a contributor.
         - Help from others on the project in implementing your feature.
         - Help from the broader community in maintaining what is written.  You are not stuck with the long-term burden of maintenance.
         - Heavy influence into the final product.
         - Assurance that the final product will be useful for you.
         - Other features built into the final product will be more likely to complement the work that you have done.

## Mental/Attitude/Communications
   - A lot of times I want to make a contribution but it’s hard to be OK with them saying “no” or that their goals are different then mine as a contributor.  How do you walk away from that feeling good.
      - Adjust and have realistic expectations
      - Empathy and humility
   - Have a contributing mindset - think outside your project and look for places to contribute instead of reinventing the wheel.
      - A contributing mindset starts with a shared use mindset.  You’ll likely have to be comfortable using other folks’ stuff before it is realistic to contribute to it.
         - Think about contributing.  Every time you’re working on something in a project that is not related to the purpose or domain of that project, look for the proper home for that code.
   - Use the Guest in a home analogy.
   - Nothing too small to contribute!!!!!!
   - Understand that you have to ‘sell’ your idea - communicate early and often -before- investing a lot of time in coding an idea (fail fast)
   - ‘Selling’ your participation to your management team - let them know of the benefits we've already discussed.
   - Understand the general purpose of the project enough to know what your contribution makes sense as an overall part of the project instead of just your personal snowflake
   - If your contribution is large, be sure to start queuing it up early enough so that it's "in" by the time that you need it.

## Technical Concerns
   - Read the CONTRIBUTING.md and follow it.
   - If you are contributing the fix to an issue, be sure to follow all guidance and instruction documented in the issue.
   - Update any documentation that goes along with your code.
   - Take feedback as data that helps you refine your idea/code
   - Even after merge, if the Host team has any questions or additional help needed from  you for them to understand and maintain what you contributed, be timely and responsive.
   - If you are stuck while working on a contribution, then check the project documentation for ways to get support.
   Don't spin or give up on your valuable addition.
   - Behave politely in pull request.
   - Comments - contributions should be documented.
   - Fixes for typos and builds are great contributions.
   - Style of code should be similar to what code is already present.

## Wrap-up/Final Thoughts
   - Treat contribution as a means to help enhance your knowledge (and career)
   - Remember you don’t necessarily have all of the answers
   - Release early, release often (‘Perfect is the enemy of good enough’)
   - Have fun!
