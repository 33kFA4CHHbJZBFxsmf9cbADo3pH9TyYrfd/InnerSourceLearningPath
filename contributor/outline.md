# InnerSource Contributor Content Outline

## The Contributor in InnerSource

  - Introduce the speaker.
  - Quick overview of the _Contributor_ role.
  - Summary of the roles of InnerSource and how each relates to _Contributor_.
  - Summary of the upcoming segments and what each covers.

Outline for this section inspired by the [Trusted Committer introduction video].

## The Contribution Ethos

  - A contributing mindset starts with a shared use mindset.
    - When you have technical needs that are outside of the domain of your project,
    look around to see if there is a shared solution that you can use.
    - Share anecdote or hypothetical situation of a time where a team was able to reuse what others had done rather than reinventing the wheel.
    Briefly enumerate the benefits of using shared solutions.
  - Using shared solutions puts you in a position to become a _Contributor_.
    - There will be times when you wish that the shared solution has some new feature.
    - Don't _Wait it Out_ or _Work Around_, spend your time and energy making the change directly in the shared project.
    - Briefly enumerate the benefits of contributing.
    This should be taken from the **Benefits** segment.
    - An InnerSource _Contributor_ knows that it doesn't matter where the code goes as long as the team can get the functionality that theyneed.
  - Contributing applies to all levels of project managements, not just code.
    - Opening issues.
    - Improving documention.
    - Fixing builds.
    - Nothing too small to contribute (e.g. documentation typo).
      - [Here is one](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/pull/4784) that I made to `tensorflow/models`.

## How to Contribute

  - Introduce the guest in a home analogy.
  A good guest:
    - Knocks at the door.
    - Anticipates and follows house rules.
    - Understands they are not the home owner and acts accordingly.
  Let's talk about how each of these ideas applies in InnerSource.
  - Getting in
    - In the real world their are several ways that guests are invited in.
      - Knock on the door unexpected.
      - Knock on the door after invited.
      - An "open" sign lets them know they can walk right in without knocking
    - With InnerSource projects there are several ways that code gets in.
      - Sometimes you just open a pull request.
      - At times you may need to get a feature request accepted before opening the pull request that fulfills it.
      - You may need to talk to the host team before interacting with the project digitally.
    - Many InnerSource projects outline how they like to be approached by potential _Contributors_ in their `README.md` or `CONTRIBUTING.md` files.
  - Following the rules
  


- How to get your contribution accepted.

   - A lot of times I want to make a contribution but it’s hard to be OK with them saying “no” or that their goals are different then mine as a contributor.  How do you walk away from that feeling good.
      - Adjust and have realistic expectations
      - Empathy and humility
      
    - Can a contributor coach a *host* team on contributing? -> You may suggest something in a humble way, but after all it's their house. (You shouldn't put with overly shitty hosts/home-owners though)

   - Understand that you have to ‘sell’ your idea - communicate early and often -before- investing a lot of time in coding an idea (fail fast)
    - What best practices might be shared so that the reader/contributor knows how to "sell" their idea? Give a framework or protocol to follow so that the contributor is helpful to the owner rather then needy/burdensome.
   - ‘Selling’ your participation to your management team - let them know of the benefits we've already discussed. (Term: "Inner Source marketing")
   - Understand the general purpose of the project enough to know what your contribution makes sense as an overall part of the project instead of just your personal snowflake
   - If your contribution is large, be sure to start queuing it up early enough so that it's "in" by the time that you need it
   - Remember that everyone is working together to do their best, leave any sense of entitlement or privilege behind when interacting with the host team.

   - Read the CONTRIBUTING.md and follow it.
    - Keep in mind larger timezone differences when managing your expectations for reaction times.
   - If you are contributing the fix to an issue, be sure to follow all guidance and instruction documented in the issue.
   - Update any documentation that goes along with your code.
   - Take feedback as data that helps you refine your idea/code
   - Even after merge, if the Host team has any questions or additional help needed from  you for them to understand and maintain what you contributed, be timely and responsive.
    - the '30 days warranty' pattern appears to be relevant here. Otherwise given the change of teams in person a "fear of maintenance" and the matching "fear to consume iss artifacts" can ensue.
   - If you are stuck while working on a contribution, then check the project documentation for ways to get support.
   Don't spin or give up on your valuable addition.
   - Behave politely in pull request.
   - Comments - contributions should be documented.
   - Style of code should be similar to what code is already present.
   - Release early, release often (‘Perfect is the enemy of good enough’)
   - Remember you don’t necessarily have all of the answers

## Benefits of Contribution
- Personally
- Team
- Company

   - Discuss the value of contribution
      - ‘With many eyes, all bugs are shallow’
      - Improve cross-company collaboration
      - Reduce single points of failure (team or personal)
      
   - Contribution Rationale
         - If you're going to spend the time on it anyway, you might as well do it in a place where you're throwing in your lot with others who are also working in the area.
      - Prevent/reduce duplication of efforts through many teams
      - Increasing personal reputation
      - Things that you gain as a contributor.
         - Help from others on the project in implementing your feature.
         - Help from the broader community in maintaining what is written.  You are not stuck with the long-term burden of maintenance.
         - Heavy influence into the final product.
         - Assurance that the final product will be useful for you.
         - Other features built into the final product will be more likely to complement the work that you have done.

   - It's better for the company overall to put your time into something that can be reused and shared rather than just your own thing.  Play as part of the larger team!
   - Treat contribution as a means to help enhance your knowledge (and career)
            - If you're going to spend the time on it anyway, you might as well do it in a place where you're throwing in your lot with others who are also working in the area.

      - Have fun!
