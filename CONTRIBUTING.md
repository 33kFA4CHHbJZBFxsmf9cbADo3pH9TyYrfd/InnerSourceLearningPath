Thanks for contributing.  A few tips:

* When submitting new files, follow the folder structure listed under **Repository Setup** in [the README](./README.md).
* Write each new sentence on a new line.
GitHub allows leaving comments on a line-by-line basis.
Review and comment on the content of submitted text is much easier if there are multiple lines on-which to leave comments.
Sentences on consecutive lines will be collapsed into a single paragraph (like this one) in the final rendering of the content.
* When reviewing a pull request, make suggestions via regular comment.
If you have a specific text to suggest, use the [the _GitHub_ "suggestion" feature][suggestion feature].
