Thanks for contributing.  A few tips:

# Files

* When submitting new files, follow the folder structure listed under **Repository Setup** in [the README](./README.md).
* Write each new sentence on a new line.
GitHub allows leaving comments on a line-by-line basis.
Review and comment on the content of submitted text is much easier if there are multiple lines on-which to leave comments.
Sentences on consecutive lines will be collapsed into a single paragraph (like this one) in the final rendering of the content.
* Avoiding inserting non-sentence or structure-intended extra line breaks.
This approach allows for easier editing and re-arrangement of text.
* When reviewing a pull request, make suggestions via regular comment.
If you have a specific text to suggest, use the [the _GitHub_ "suggestion" feature][suggestion feature].
The author can easily [incorporate your suggestions][incorporate suggestions].

# Issues

* When opening a new issue, be sure to add it to the `Learning Path Segements` project so that appears on the [project board].
* If the issue is specific to the `Introduction`, `Trusted Committer`, `Product Owner`, or `Contributor` section, then add those label(s).
If the issue applies to the Learning Path in-general but not to any specific section then use the `Meta` label.
